Project Title: Cat vs. Dog Image Classification (Convolutional Neural Network)

Description:

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as cats or dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of grayscale cat and dog images. The code includes functions for loading and pre-processing images, building the CNN architecture, training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

Key Features:

Image Preprocessing: Loads grayscale images, resizes them to a fixed size, and normalizes pixel values between 0 and 1.
CNN Architecture: Employs a sequential stack of convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max pooling layers for feature extraction. Dense layers with ReLU and sigmoid activation are used for classification.
Training and Evaluation: Trains the model using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss. Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for performance evaluation using accuracy.
Visualization: Plots training and validation accuracy/loss curves to monitor learning progress.
Prediction: Provides a function to load an image, predict its class (cat or dog), and display the image with the prediction.
Model Saving: Saves the trained model for future use.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (cv2, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow.keras).
Execute the Python script (assuming it's named cat_dog_classifier.py).
The script will load and pre-process the images, train the model, visualize the results, and provide a function to make predictions on new images.
